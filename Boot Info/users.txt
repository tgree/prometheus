;This file must be called "users.txt" and live in a directory called "Boot Info" which
;can be found in the same directory the the "Kernel Booter" directory is in:
;
;	/myHD
;	  /Prometheus
;	    /Kernel Booter
;	    /Boot Info
;	        users.txt
;
;User info file.  A line starting with ; is a comment line.  Comments must
;start at the beginning of the line.  User info is stored like this:
;
;username
;password
;<property1> <tab> <value1> <tab> <value2> ...
;<property2> <tab> <value1> <tab> <value2> ...
;
;Properties can be any string (by convention they should be all lowercase)
;that can be looked up for this particular user.  The (optional) values are seperated
;from the property by a single tab.  All lines must terminate with a newline
;immediately after the data on that line.  Different users are seperated by
;one or more newlines.  The file is terminated with any line starting with "-".
;Any information or text past that line is ignored.
;
;Eventually the password line for every user will be encrypted.  EVENTUALLY this
;entire file will be encrypted.  But for now it will suffice.
;
;The following is a list of valid properties.  New ones should be added to
;the list as they are created.  Any other properties will be ignored by the kernel.
;
;<kernel-directory>	<boot-directory>|<select>
;		This optional property allows the user to configure which kernel directory
;		to continue the boot process from after login.
;		<boot-directory> means the kernel tries to use the directory it booted from.  This
;			is the default setting for the boot process.
;		<select> means that the kernel asks the user to select after login.
;
;<operating-systems>	<os1>	<os2>	<os3>
;		This optional property allows the user to configure which operating systems
;		the kernel should load after login.  Any operating systems in the list but not
;		present in the "Operating Systems" subdirectory are ignored.  An empty list indicates
;		that no operating systems should be loaded.  The absence of this identifier
;		indicates that all operating systems should be loaded.
;
;Any other properties which are specific to a certain operating system should be
;prefixed by a key for that operating system:
;
;		OS_Stupid OS	-	os_stupidos_
;		Moira	-	moira_

;Typical root user.
